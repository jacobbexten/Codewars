# RectangleIntoSquares
The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?  

You will be given two dimensions  

1. a positive integer length
2. a positive integer width  

You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

Examples in general form:
(depending on the language)

```
  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
```
